# 1000 days in San Francisco

I spent 1000 days in San Francisco and collected my social media posts about how I felt about the area during that time.

### Side note

The background being generared to make the image seem "noisy" is actually a randomly generated recreation of Ellsworthy Kelly's [Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance](https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/99.352
) in similar color proportions as the original. You can see the original piece in San Francisco at the SFMOMA.
